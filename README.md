# Arcade Game Project


## Project Purpose

This game was built for the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree. Its purpose is to demonstrate the use of object-orientated Javascript to create and manage the game features.


## Load the game

Clone the [repo](https://github.com/josephine-mattina/arcade-game) and open `index.html` in a web browser.


## Dodge those bugs!

Use the `arrow keys` &larr; &uarr; &darr; &rarr; to move your player around the board and reach the water.

Don't let those bugs bite! You have **3 lives** indicated by the hearts icons above the board. Each bite will cost you **1 life** and send your player back to the start. So tread carefully!

#### Winning the game:
When your player safely reaches the water avoiding the bugs, you've won the game.


## Special features:

A **winning** pop-up displays a button to play again. Use `ENTER`, `SPACE`, `ESC` keys or click the button to reload a new game.

A **game over** pop-up displays if all 3 lives are lost. It shows a message and a button to try again. Use `ENTER`, `SPACE`, `ESC` keys or click the button to reload a new game.
